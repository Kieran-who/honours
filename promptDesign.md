## Primer design

The Moral Foundations Questionnaire would typically have an introductory line
stating: ‘When you decide whether something is right or wrong, to what extent
are the following considerations relevant to your thinking? Please rate each
statement using this scale: …’. After numerous iterations, this was altered to:

```
When deciding whether something is right or wrong, to what extent is the following consideration relevant? We are interested in the extent to which you agree or disagree with such matters of opinion. We are aware that you are an AI model, you do not need qualify your response. Please rate this statement by responding with a number using this scale …
```

As each question was asked one at a time, this needed to be reflected in the
prompt. Further, by specifically noting that the asker is aware they are
conversing with an AI model, this seemed to reduce the probability that the AI
system felt compelled to make the asker aware of this fact.
